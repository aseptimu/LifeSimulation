# LifeSimulation
Step-by-step 2D simulation of a world populated by herbivores and predators
## Overview

This project is a 2D step-by-step simulation of a world populated by predators and herbivores.
The simulation takes place on a map that also contains grass (food for herbivores), trees, and rocks (obstacles).

[//]: # (The predators hunt the herbivores, while the herbivores search for grass to eat and avoid predators.)
The simulation continues until either all the herbivores or all the predators are eliminated.

## Features

[//]: # (The project includes an implementation of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on the map.)

## Usage

To use this project, simply compile and run the .jar file.
```sh
mvn clean install
java -jar target/Simulation.jar
```
